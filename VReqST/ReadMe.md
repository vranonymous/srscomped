**VReqST - Requirement Specification Tool Support for Virtual Reality Products**

Virtual Reality (VR) Environments are challenging to build with discrete and incremental requirements. VR practitioners often need human assistance to achieve product completeness, as most VR requirements are either abstract or under specified. The slightest change to these requirement specifications tends to drastically impact the overall control-flow of the product. It exponentially increases the development cost. To address the completeness of specifying VR product requirements, we introduce VReqST, a tool for specifying requirements for VR software products. We use role base model template of bare-minimum VR Software to auto-provision all dimensions of VR as a domain on specifying VR product requirements. This tool avoids ambiguity while specifying requirements and provides seamless VR product development.

This repo contains sample requirement specifications of two real-time VR projects for VR practitioners reference.
